# Data Science

I will just link the resources from where I studied today.

from [1] one thing is clear, I need to work a lot with different kinds of data, like from APIs, web scraps, Databases, etc.
You can easliy get toy datasets from kaggle[2], UCI ML[3], or other sources. Upon exploring I stumbeled across data pipelines, SQL, etc.
One of the best software for building data pipelines is Apache Airflow[4]. I also stumbeled across GPU accelerated Databases systems which are used in ETL phase of Data Science.
